"""
Adaptive Differential Evolution Variants.

This module will contain self-adaptive DE algorithms with automatic
parameter control. Coming soon:

- JADE (Adaptive DE with Optional External Archive)
- SHADE (Success-History based Adaptive DE)
- jDE (Self-Adaptive DE)
- SaDE (Self-adaptive DE with Neighborhood Search)
- EPSDE (Ensemble of Parameters and Strategies DE)

These algorithms automatically adapt F, CR, and other parameters
during optimization without manual tuning.
